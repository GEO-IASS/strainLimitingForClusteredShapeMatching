\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
In this paper, we introduce incorporate ductile fracture into the clustered shape matching simulation framework
for deformable bodies, thus filling a gap in the shape matching literature. 
{\em Shape matching} is a geometrically motivated technique for animating deformable bodies introduced
a decade ago by \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.
In this approach
objects are discretized into a set of particles, $p_i\in\mathcal{P}$, with rest positions, $\B{r}_i$, 
that follow a path, $\B{x}_i(t)$, in world-space through time.  
At each frame, shape matching solves for the rotation matrix, $\B{R}$, and a translation
vector, $\B{x}_{cm}-\B{r}_{cm}$, that minimize
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \left(\B{R}\left(\B{r}_i - \B{r}_{cm}\right)-\left(\B{x}_i-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\right)^2.
\end{equation}
The best translations are given by the center-of-mass in the rest and world space, respectively.  
The rotation, $\B{R}$, is computed through a polar decomposition.  Intuitively, this computation
yields the least-squares best-fit rigid transformation from the rest pose to the current deformed pose.
This transformation allows us to define goal positions, $\B{g}_i$,
\begin{equation}
\B{g}_i = \B{R}\left(\B{r}_i-\B{r}_{cm}\right)+\B{x}_{cm}.
\end{equation}
Hookean springs are then used to define forces that move the particles toward the goal positions.
This basic approach was extended by including linear and quadratic global deformations, cluster-based
deformations, and plasticity.

In their seminal work, \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB} introduced a simple plasticity
model, but did not address fracture.  In follow up work, Rivers and James~\shortcite{Rivers:2007:FFL}
incorporated a simple fracture model, but did not address plasticity.  

In this paper, we present plasticity and fracture models inspired by finite element approaches to 
animating deformable bodies.  
Specifically, inspired by the work of Irving and colleagues~\shortcite{Irving:2004:IFE} and Bargteil and 
colleagues~\shortcite{Bargteil:2007:AFE}, we introduce a multiplicative plasticity model that incorporates
yield stress, flow rate, and work hardening.  Inspired by the work of O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:1999:GMA,Obrien:2002:GMA},
we introduce a cluster-based fracture approach that splits individual clusters along the plane orthogonal to the direction the 
cluster is most stretched.
Taken together these contributions allow animation of ductile in the clustered shape matching framework.

\section{Related Work}
The geometrically motivated shape matching approach was introduced by \Mueller and 
colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}, who demonstrated impressive results and 
described the key advantages of the approach: efficiency, stability, and controllability.
Given these advantages, shape matching is especially appealing in interactive animation contexts such 
video games.  The authors also introduced several extensions including linear and quadratic deformations 
(in addition to rigid deformations), cluster-based deformation, and plasticity.  

Two years later, Rivers and James~\shortcite{Rivers:2007:FFL} introduced lattice-based shape matching,
which used a set of hierarchical lattices to define the shape matching clusters.  They took advantage
of the regular structure of the lattices to achieve extremely high performance.  They also incorporated a 
simple fracture model that removed over-extended links in the lattice.  

Since this time, the shape matching framework has been largely disregarded by the research community in favor of position-based
dynamics~\cite{Mueller:2007:PBD,Bender:2013:PBM,Bender:2014:ASO,Macklin:2014:UPP}.  One notable exception is
the work of Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF}, which incorporated strain-limiting into clustered shape matching.
We incorporate our ductile fracture approach into their framework.

Ductile fracture is distinguished from brittle fracture by the inclusion plastic deformation.  Materials undergoing ductile
fracture (e.g. play dough) appear to {\em tear}, while brittle materials (e.g. glass) appear to {\em shatter}.  Most
real-world materials demonstrate some amount of plastic deformation during failure, so purely brittle models have fairly limited
application in computer animation.  
Both plasticity and fracture
were first demonstrated in computer animation by the pioneering work of Terzopoulos and Fleischer~\shortcite{Terzopoulos:1988:MID}; 
however, it was O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:2002:GMA}
who first combined these phenomena to animate ductile fracture.  Since that time, plasticity and fracture have
remained very active research areas in computer animation and a thorough review is beyond the scope of this short paper.
\adam{in part this is because I am lazy, does anyone think it would be important?}

Our approach 
to fracture closely resembles that of O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:1999:GMA,Obrien:2002:GMA}; however, instead of splitting tetrahedra,
we split shape matching clusters.  Our plasticity model closely resembles that of Bargteil and colleagues~\shortcite{Bargteil:2007:AFE}, except that
we apply it to shape matching clusters instead of individual tetrahedra and make no particular effort to ensure that plastic deformation does not
lead to insability, i.e. we do not update clusters to ensure well-conditioned matrices as done by, for example, Jones and colleagues~\shortcite{Jones:2014:DEF}.
