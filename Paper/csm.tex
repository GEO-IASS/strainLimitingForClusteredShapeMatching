\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
{\em Shape matching} is a geometrically motivated technique for animating deformable bodies introduced
a decade ago by \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.
\fref{fig:shapematching} summarizes the approach.
In their seminal work, \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB} introduced a simple plasticity
model and, in follow up work, Rivers and James~\shortcite{Rivers:2007:FFL}
incorporated a simple fracture model.  However, ductile fracture has not yet been addressed in the
shape matching literature.

%In this paper, we incorporate ductile fracture into the clustered shape matching simulation framework
%for deformable bodies, thus filling a gap in the shape matching literature. 
In this paper, we enable the animation of ductile fracture 
by incorporating plasticity and fracture models into the clustered shape matching framework.
Our models are inspired by finite element approaches to animating deformable bodies, but are adapted to 
clustered shape matching.
Specifically, inspired by the work of Irving and colleagues~\shortcite{Irving:2004:IFE} and Bargteil and 
colleagues~\shortcite{Bargteil:2007:AFE}, we introduce a multiplicative plasticity model that incorporates
yield stress, flow rate, and work hardening.  Inspired by the work of O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:1999:GMA,Obrien:2002:GMA},
we introduce a cluster-based fracture approach that splits individual clusters along the plane orthogonal to the direction the 
cluster is most stretched.
Taken together these contributions allow animation of ductile fracturein the clustered shape matching framework.

\section{Related Work}
The geometrically motivated shape matching approach was introduced by \Mueller and 
colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}, who demonstrated impressive results and 
described the key advantages of the approach: efficiency, stability, and controllability.
Given these advantages, shape matching is especially appealing in interactive animation contexts such as
video games.  The authors also introduced several extensions including linear and quadratic deformations 
(in addition to rigid deformations), cluster-based deformation, and plasticity.  

Two years later, Rivers and James~\shortcite{Rivers:2007:FFL} introduced lattice-based shape matching,
which used a set of hierarchical lattices to define the shape matching clusters.  They took advantage
of the regular structure of the lattices to achieve extremely high performance.  They also incorporated a 
simple fracture model that removed over-extended links in the lattice.  

Since this time, the shape matching framework has been largely disregarded by the research community in favor of position-based
dynamics~\cite{Mueller:2007:PBD,Bender:2013:PBM,Bender:2014:ASO,Macklin:2014:UPP}.  One notable exception is
the work of Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF}, which incorporated strain-limiting into clustered shape matching.
We incorporate our ductile fracture approach into their framework.

Ductile fracture is distinguished from brittle fracture by the inclusion of plastic deformation.  Materials undergoing ductile
fracture (e.g. play dough) appear to {\em tear}, while brittle materials (e.g. glass) appear to {\em shatter}.  Most
real-world materials demonstrate some amount of plastic deformation during failure, so purely brittle models have fairly limited
application in computer animation.  
Both plasticity and fracture
were first demonstrated in computer animation by the pioneering work of Terzopoulos and Fleischer~\shortcite{Terzopoulos:1988:MID}; 
however, it was O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:2002:GMA}
who first combined these phenomena to animate ductile fracture.  Since that time, plasticity and fracture have
remained very active research areas in computer animation and a thorough review is beyond the scope of this short paper.
\adam{in part this is because I am lazy, does anyone think it would be important?}
\josh{I think the review would only be important if we were able to draw
a conclusion like ``the most promising way to apply it in the context of
csm is blah...'', or some other general trend regarding it that's
applicable in this context}

Our approach 
to fracture closely resembles that of O'Brien and colleagues~\shortcite{Obrien:1999:GMA,Obrien:2002:GMA}; however, instead of splitting tetrahedra,
we split shape matching clusters.  Our plasticity model closely resembles that of Bargteil and colleagues~\shortcite{Bargteil:2007:AFE}, except that
we apply it to shape matching clusters instead of individual tetrahedra and make no particular effort to ensure that plastic deformation does not
lead to instability, i.e.~we do not update clusters to ensure well-conditioned matrices as done by, for example, Jones and colleagues~\shortcite{Jones:2014:DEF}.

\section{Methods}
For completeness and readability, we first briefly review the shape matching approach of \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB} before
introducing our plasticity and fracture models.  Finally we briefly discuss our approaches to sampling and clustering.
\subsection{Shape Matching}
\label{sec:ShapeMatching}
In the shape matching framework
objects are discretized into a set of particles, $p_i\in\mathcal{P}$, with rest positions, $\B{r}_i$, 
that follow a path, $\B{x}_i(t)$, in world-space through time.  
Shape matching takes its name from the fact that, each frame, we match the rest shape to 
the deformed shape by finding
the least-squares best-fit rigid transformation from the rest pose
to the current deformed pose by
solving for the rotation matrix, $\B{R}$, and translation
vector, $\B{x}_{cm}-\B{r}_{cm}$, that minimize
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \left(\B{R}\left(\B{r}_i - \B{r}_{cm}\right)-\left(\B{x}_i-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\right)^2.
\end{equation}
The best translation is given by the center-of-mass in the rest and world space.  
Computing the rotation, $\B{R}$, is more involved.  
We first compute the least-squares best-fit linear deformation gradient, $\B{F}$.
Specifically, we seek the $\B{F}$ that minimizes
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \left(\B{F}\left(\B{r}_i - \B{r}_{cm}\right)-\left(\B{x}_i-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Setting the derivative with respect to $\B{F}$ to $0$ and re-arranging terms we arrive at
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:defgrad}
\B{F} = \left(\sum_i m_i \B{O}(\B{x}_i,\B{r}_i)\right)\left(\sum_im_i\B{O}(\B{r}_i,\B{r}_i)\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $\B{O}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the outer product matrix
\begin{equation}
\B{O}(\B{a}_i,\B{b}_i) = \left(\B{a}_i-\B{a}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{b}_{i}-\B{b}_{cm}\right)^T
\end{equation}
%\begin{align}
%\B{F} = &\left(\sum_i m_i\left(\B{x}_{i}-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)^T\right)\notag\\
%&\left(\sum_i m_i\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)^T\right)^{-1},
%\end{align}
and $m_i$ is the mass of $p_i$. 
We then compute $\B{R}$ using the polar decomposition,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:decomp}
\B{F} = \B{R}\B{S} = \left(\B{UV}^T\right)\left(\B{V\Sigma V}^T\right)
\end{equation}
where $\B{S}=\B{V\Sigma V}^T$ is a symmetric matrix and $\B{U\Sigma V}^T$ is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\B{F}$.
While several researchers (e.g.~\cite{Rivers:2007:FFL}) have pointed out that the polar decompositions can be computed faster than the SVD,
especially when warm started, we use the SVD for its robustness and for our plasticity and fracture models 
(see~
%\srefs{sec:Plasticity}{sec:Fracture}
).  
We also note that we compute the polar decomposition of $\B{F}$, not
the left matrix ($\sum_im_i\B{O}(\B{x}_i,\B{r}_i)$) as done by \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.  This modification
is particularly important if the distribution of mass in the cluster is non-uniform.

This transformation allows us to define goal positions, $\B{g}_i$,
\begin{equation}
\B{g}_i = \B{R}\left(\B{r}_i-\B{r}_{cm}\right)+\B{x}_{cm}.
\end{equation}
Hookean springs are then used to define forces that move the particles toward the goal positions.

\paragraph{Clustered Shape Matching}
Handling multiple clusters is straightforward.  When computing the cluster mass and center-of-mass,
we divide a particle's mass by the number of clusters it belongs to.  That is if particle, $p_i$ belongs
to $n_i$ clusters, then the center-of-mass of cluster $c$, $\B{x}_{cm,c}$ is
\begin{equation}
\B{x}_{cm,c} = \frac{\sum_{p_i\in\mathcal{P}_c}(m_i/n_i)\B{x_i}}{\sum_{p_i\in\mathcal{P}_c}(m_i/n_i)},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_c$ is the set of particles in cluster $c$.
Furthermore, when computing the goal position, $\B{g}_i$ for a particle we perform a simple
average of the goal positions given by each cluster it is a part of.  That is,
\begin{equation}
\B{g}_i = \frac{\B{g}_{ic}}{n_i},
\end{equation}
where $\B{g}_{ic}$ is the goal position for particle $p_i$ in cluster $c$.

\paragraph{Strain Limiting}
To maintain stability we adopt the strain limiting approach advocated by Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF}.

\subsection{Plasticity}
\label{sec:Plasticity}
To accommodate plastic deformation we store and update an additional matrix, $\B{F}^p_c$ for each cluster, $c$.
For readability we drop the subscript, but the following is computed for each cluster.
We then compute the elastic part of the deformation gradient
\begin{equation}
\B{F}^e = \B{F} \left(\B{F}^p\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $\B{F}$ is given by~\eref{eq:defgrad}.  We then decompose $\B{F}^e$ in~\eref{eq:decomp}.

$\B{F}^p$ is initialized to the identity, $\B{I}$.  Then each timestep we compute the volume preserving part 
of the diagonalized $\B{F}^e$,
\begin{equation}
\B{F}^* = \det(\B{\Sigma}^e)^{-1/3}\B{\Sigma}^e.
\end{equation}
We then compare
\begin{equation}
\|\B{F}^* - \B{I}\|_F
\end{equation}
to a plastic yield threshold, $\lambda$, where $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm.  If the threshold
is not exceeded $\B{F}^p$ remains unchanged.  Otherwise we update $\B{F}^p$ by
\begin{equation}
\B{F}^p_{new} = \left(\B{F}^*\right)^\gamma\B{V}\B{F}^p_{old},
\end{equation}
where $\B{V}$ is the matrix of right singular vectors in~\eref{eq:decomp} and $\gamma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\gamma = \min\left(\frac{\nu * \|\B{F}^* - \B{I}\|_F - \lambda - K\alpha}{\|\B{F}^* - \B{I}\|_F},1\right),
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ and $K$ are user-given flow rate and work hardening/softening constant, respectively, 
and $\alpha$ is a measure of cumulative stress that is initialized to zero and then updated by
\begin{equation}
\dot{\alpha} = \|\B{F}^e-\B{I}\|_F.
\end{equation}
We do not apply additional rotations when computing $\B{F}^p_{new}$ as these would be discarded during
the decomposition in~\eref{eq:decomp}.


\subsection{Fracture}
\label{sec:Fracture}
We duplicate $\B{F}^p$ to the new cluster.

\subsection{Sampling and Clustering}

Both the distribution of particles that model and object as well as the
clustering of particles can affect the simulation quality.  We
experiment with both uniform sampling as well as blue noise sampling.
Our blue noise sampler is based on Bridson's fast Poisson disk
sampling~\cite{Bridson:2007:FPD}.  In either case, for objects whose
boundary is an arbitrary manifold, we simple sample particles within
the bounding box of the sample, and then discard for particles within
the surface.

To avoid mass lumping, our approach for clustering is a variant of the
well know $k$-means algorithm.  The user is allowed to specify both the
number of clusters, $n$, as well as a target neighborhood radius, $d$.
We initialize $n$ clusters as randomly selected seed particles.
Particles are then placed into whichever cluster they are closest to.
We then iteratively compute the center of mass for each cluster, and
redistribute the particles into the clusters based on distance to the
nearest center of mass.  This process iterates until clustering has
converged.  Finally, we then include all particles within any cluster
provided that the distance between the particle and the cluster center
of mass is less than $d$.
