\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we address clustering and collision detection in the clustered shape matching simulation framework
for deformable bodies.  Our clustering algorithm resembles fuzzy c-means and gives particles weighted membership in clusters.
We then use the weights to divide the particles mass among the clusters, resulting in very even distribution of mass over an 
object.  By design our clustering algorithm also forms spherical clusters yielding exceptionally convenient collision geometry.  We further 
enhance this simple collision proxy with halfspaces to allow for fracture or other simple geometric operations.
The resulting approach is fast, versatile, and simple to implement.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
{\em Shape matching} is a geometrically motivated technique for animating deformable bodies introduced
a decade ago by \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.
\fref{fig:shapematching} summarizes the approach.


\begin{figure*}

(c)  The best-fitting rigid transformation of the particles' rest positions, $\B{r}_i$,

\section{Related Work}
The geometrically motivated shape matching approach was introduced by \Mueller and 
colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}, who demonstrated impressive results and 
described the key advantages of the approach: efficiency, stability, and controllability.
Given these advantages, shape matching is especially appealing in interactive animation contexts such as
video games.  The authors also introduced several extensions including linear and quadratic deformations 
(in addition to rigid deformations), cluster-based deformation, and plasticity.  

Two years later, Rivers and James~\shortcite{Rivers:2007:FFL} introduced lattice-based shape matching,
which used a set of hierarchical lattices to define the shape matching clusters.  They took advantage
of the regular structure of the lattices to achieve extremely high performance.  They also incorporated a 
simple fracture model that removed over-extended links in the lattice.  

Despite impressive results and substantial promise,
the shape matching framework has been largely disregarded by the research community in favor of position-based
dynamics~\cite{Mueller:2007:PBD,Bender:2013:PBM,Bender:2014:ASO,Macklin:2014:UPP}.  One notable exception is
the work of Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF}, which incorporated strain-limiting into clustered shape matching
and pointed out several advantages of shape matching over position-based dynamics.

\section{Methods}
For completeness and readability, we first briefly review the shape matching approach of \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.
\subsection{Shape Matching}
\label{sec:ShapeMatching}
In the shape matching framework
objects are discretized into a set of particles, $p_i\in\mathcal{P}$, with masses, $m_i$, and rest positions, $\B{r}_i$, 
that follow a path, $\B{x}_i(t)$, in world-space through time.  
Shape matching takes its name from the fact that, each frame, we match the rest shape to 
the deformed shape by finding
the least-squares best-fit rigid transformation from the rest pose
to the current deformed pose by
solving for the rotation matrix, $\B{R}$, and translation
vector, $\B{x}_{cm}-\B{r}_{cm}$, that minimizes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sm}
\sum_i m_i \| \B{R}\left(\B{r}_i - \B{r}_{cm}\right)-\left(\B{x}_i-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\|^2.
\end{equation}
The best translation is given by the center-of-mass in the rest and world space.  
Computing the rotation, $\B{R}$, is more involved.  
We first compute the least-squares best-fit linear deformation gradient, $\B{F}$.
Specifically, we seek the $\B{F}$ that minimizes
\begin{equation}
\sum_i m_i \| \B{F}\left(\B{r}_i - \B{r}_{cm}\right)-\left(\B{x}_i-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\|^2.
\end{equation}
Setting the derivative with respect to $\B{F}$ to $0$ and re-arranging terms we arrive at
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:defgrad}
\B{F} = \left(\sum_i m_i \B{O}(\B{x}_i,\B{r}_i)\right)\left(\sum_im_i\B{O}(\B{r}_i,\B{r}_i)\right)^{-1} = \B{A}_{xr}\B{A}_{rr}^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $\B{O}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the outer product matrix
\begin{equation}
\B{O}(\B{a}_i,\B{b}_i) = \left(\B{a}_i-\B{a}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{b}_{i}-\B{b}_{cm}\right)^T,
\end{equation}
and $\B{A}_{**}$ is a convenient shorthand.
%\begin{align}
%\B{F} = &\left(\sum_i m_i\left(\B{x}_{i}-\B{x}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)^T\right)\notag\\
%&\left(\sum_i m_i\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)\left(\B{r}_{i}-\B{r}_{cm}\right)^T\right)^{-1},
%\end{align}
%and $m_i$ is the mass of $p_i$. 
We then compute $\B{R}$ using the polar decomposition,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:decomp}
\B{F} = \B{R}\B{S} = \left(\B{UV}^T\right)\left(\B{V\Sigma V}^T\right)
\end{equation}
where $\B{S}=\B{V\Sigma V}^T$ is a symmetric matrix and $\B{U\Sigma V}^T$ is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\B{F}$.
While several researchers (e.g.~\cite{Rivers:2007:FFL}) have pointed out that polar decompositions can be computed faster than the SVD,
especially when warm started, we use the SVD for its robustness and for our plasticity and fracture models 
(see~\srefs{sec:Plasticity}{sec:Fracture}).  
We also note that we compute the polar decomposition of $\B{F}$, not
the left matrix ($\B{A}_{xr}$)
%($\sum_im_i\B{O}(\B{x}_i,\B{r}_i)$) 
as done by \Mueller and colleagues~\shortcite{Mueller:2005:MDB}.  This modification
is particularly important if the distribution of mass in the cluster is non-uniform and $\B{F}$ is not a pure rotation.

Given $\B{R}$ and $\B{x}_{cm}-\B{r}_{cm}$, we define goal positions, $\B{g}_i$, as
\begin{equation}
\B{g}_i = \B{R}\left(\B{r}_i-\B{r}_{cm}\right)+\B{x}_{cm}.
\end{equation}
Hookean springs are then used to define forces that move the particles toward the goal positions.

\paragraph{Clustered Shape Matching}
Handling multiple clusters is straightforward.  When computing a particle's contribution to 
cluster quantities, we divide the particle's mass by the number of clusters it belongs to,
essentially replacing $m_i$ with $m_i/n_i$ in equations \eqref{eq:sm}-\eqref{eq:defgrad} 
and when computing cluster mass and center-of-mass.
Specifically, if particle $p_i$ belongs
to $n_i$ clusters, then the center-of-mass of cluster $c$, $\B{x}_{cm,c}$, is
\begin{equation}
\B{x}_{cm,c} = \frac{\sum_{p_i\in\mathcal{P}_c}(m_i/n_i)\B{x_i}}{\sum_{p_i\in\mathcal{P}_c}(m_i/n_i)},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_c$ is the set of particles in cluster $c$.
Furthermore, when computing the goal position, $\B{g}_i$, for a particle we perform a simple
average of the goal positions given by each cluster it is a part of.  That is,
\begin{equation}
\B{g}_i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_c \B{g}_{i,c},
\end{equation}
where $\B{g}_{i,c}$ is the goal position for particle $p_i$ in cluster $c$.

\paragraph{Strain Limiting}
To maintain stability we adopt the strain limiting approach advocated by Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF}.
However, in the presence of plastic deformation (see~\sref{sec:Plasticity}) we typically increase the maximum allowed stretch ($\gamma$ in
their paper) to avoid instabilities when clusters disagree about the current rest shape.

We have used our method to animate a number of examples of ductile fracture.  Timing results
taken on a Macbook Pro with a 2.4GHz Intel i5 processor.
are given in table~\tref{table:timing}.
In all particle renderings, particle color is used to indicate the nearest cluster center.  
We stress that clusters overlap and that particles typically belong to more than one cluster.

\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\caption{Timing results in ms per frame taken on a Macbook Pro with a 2.4Ghz Intel i5 processor.}
\label{table:timing}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
example & \# particles & dynamics & plasticity & fracture & total\\
\hline
armadillo & 20115 & 16  & $<$ 1 & $<$ 1 & 24\\
twisted bar & 5317 & 7 & $<$ 1  & 0 & 7\\
twisted bar with fracture & 5317 & 7  & $<$ 1 & $<$ 1 & 9 \\
projectile & 5325 & 20 & $<$ 1 & $<$ 1 & 29\\
broken heart & 20132 & 22 & $<$ 1 & $<$1 & 31\\
swiss cheese & 25032 & 27 & $<$ 1 & $<$1 & 39 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table*}

In our first example, an armadillo is tortured by simultaneously pulling on and firing
cannonballs at its arms (see~\fref{fig:teaser}).
Our second example is more didactic; a simple bar is twisted (see~\fref{fig:twistedbar}).  First we demonstrate 
plastic deformation, which allows the bar to maintain its twisted shape, then we enable fracture. 
In our third example a projectile is fired through a thin sheet of material (see~\fref{fig:projectile}).  
In our heartbreaking fourth example a complex shape is pulled apart (see~\fref{fig:teaser}).  The complex shape determines
where the tear begins and how it propagates.  Similarly, in our final example the holes in a 
slice of swiss cheese determine how the model is torn (see~\fref{fig:teaser}).

%Timing stuff: make a table shell and I can fill it in.  Probably makes sense to do average time/frame of simulation (shape matching/strain limiting), fracture, plasticity.

%One view of clustered shape matching is that there are far fewer integration units than degrees of freedom compared to
%fem.  This makes sense for computer graphics applications where degrees of freedom correspond lead to visual detail 
%while integrations units lead to computational cost.

%We could compare our approaches to plasticity and fracture to Irving2004,Barteil2007 and O'Brien1999. 

\paragraph{Limitations and Future Work}
%\ben{limitation: variable framerate, fracture can slow down the simulation IMMENSELY in current implementation}
Our approach has a number of limitations that provide ample potential for future work in clustered shape matching.
One limitation of our implementation is that we only handle simple collision geometry and do not handle self-collisions.
More complicated collision geometry should be easily handled using well-established signed-distance field approaches~\cite{Guendelman:2003:NRB}.
Handling self-collisions would require further research; the sphere-packing approach of Budsberg and colleagues~\shortcite{Budsberg:2014:EPD}
seems particularly promising.  
Another limitation of our current implementation is that the computational cost is somewhat unpredictable; many fractures occurring at once
can have a very significant impact on performance.  In the future it would be interesting to explore asynchronous fracturing
where, instead of emptying the priority queue every timestep, it is processed as computational resources allow.

Like many fracture methods in computer animation, we do not have a good solution to generating fractured
geometry.  Like previous work~\cite{Mueller:2005:MDB,Rivers:2007:FFL}, we can embed a high-resolution 
render mesh for unbreakable objects, but creating new geometry when fracture occurs is more difficult.  
Currently we use an off-the-shelf particle skinning tool~\cite{Bhattacharya:2015:ALM} to skin the simulation particles.
This approach suffers two major drawbacks: the results are low-resolution and the fracture surfaces are overly smooth.  
Moreover, since we do not handle-self collisions, we can merge components that unexpectedly pass through each other.
One approach to generating fracture geometry is to simply render the simulation geometry and increase the resolution 
where fracture occurs~\cite{Obrien:1999:GMA,Obrien:2002:GMA}.  The simulation geometry can can later be 
coarsened to improve computational efficiency~\cite{Pfaff:2014:ATC}.  This approach leads to
somewhat unpredictable costs and is, at present, too slow for the interactive applications where shape matching excels.
Levine and colleagues~\shortcite{Levine:2014:APP} suggested a number of other techniques for generating fracture geometry
for spring-mass systems that may be applicable in our interactive context.  Exploring these ideas is an interesting avenue 
for future work.

Our blue-noise sampling and k-means clustering improve upon the regular grids and
randomized clusters of Bargteil and Jones~\shortcite{Bargteil:2014:SLF} and are effective for our purposes,
but better approaches certainly exist.  In particular, it would be interesting to explore adaptive sampling
so that computational resources can be focused on interesting areas of the object.  
Changing the sampling over time as done by Pauly and colleagues~\shortcite{Pauly:2005:MAO}
is also a promising avenue for future work, which may help address the geometric limitations discussed above.
It would also be interesting
to consider adaptive and hierarchical clustering techniques; the hierarchical lattices of Rivers and James~\cite{Rivers:2007:FFL}
clearly improved performance and artistic directability.  
%Relatedly, we do not currently place any bounds on the minimum
%number of particles in a cluster.  Consequently our results contain many one-particle clusters, which results in a 
%``particle spray'' look that may be objectionable in some contexts.

The biggest limitation of our approach is a lack of theoretical underpinnings for the clustered shape matching
framework; we do not yet have any mathematical tools to analyze the approach.  We do not really understand
how the method behaves as particle counts or timesteps decrease or as the cluster size or number of clusters change.
This limitation does not mean the approach is not useful.  After all, the finite element method was in use
for decades before a mathematical framework was developed to analyze its properties.  In a similar way,
%even though we do not have a deep understanding of the approach, 
we believe the clustered shape-matching framework will prove extremely useful in practice while
researchers develop mathematical tools for analysis. 
%the clustered shape-matching framework, 
%with its
%relatively large particle-to-cluster ratio,
%is particularly useful for graphical applications, especially interactive applications, 
%where visual detail
%and computational efficiency are of paramount importance.

\paragraph{Conclusion} 
One of the primary advantages of the clustered shape matching approach is that the number of degrees of freedom
is much larger then the number of ``integration units''---clusters in this case.  The opposite is true of finite element
methods with unstructured meshes where the number of tetrahedra is often considerably larger than the number of vertices.  
For graphical applications visual detail, which correlates with the number of degrees of freedom, is of paramount importance
and computation, which correlates with ``integration units,'' is often limited.  
For these reasons, the clustered shape matching framework is extremely appealing for computer animation, 
especially interactive animation.  The utility and versatility of this framework is greatly improved by our extensions 
to the animation of ductile fracture.
