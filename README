This source code is an implementation of "strain limiting for clustered shape matching" from the
2014 Motion in Games paper by Adam Bargteil and Ben Jones

It should compile with a modern c++ compiler and requires only Eigen and SDL2 as dependencies.
It has been tested on OS X, but should build easily elsewhere with a couple tweaks to the makefile

We've included a simple example that can be run with ./runSimulator inputFiles/bunny.json
